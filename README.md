# Chapter-7
In this chapter, you learned how to add animations to your app to improve the UX. I implemented 
AnimatedContainer to animate the width of a Container widget with a beautiful spring effect by using Curves.elasticOut. I added the AnimatedCrossFade widget to cross-fade between two children widgets. The color is animated from amber to green while at the same time the widget increased or decreased in width and height. To fade a widget in, out, or partially, you added the AnimatedOpacity widget. The AnimatedOpacity widget uses the opacity property passed over a period of time duration to fade the widget. The AnimationController class allows the creation of custom animations. I learned to use multiple AnimationControllers with different durations. I used two Animation classes to control the floating upward or downward and the inflation and deflation of the balloon at the same time. The animation is created by using Tween with begin and end values. I also used different CurvedAnimation class for a nonlinear effect like Curves.fastOutSlowIn to float upward or downward and Curves.elasticInOut to inflate or deflate the balloon. Lastly, i used one AnimationController class with multiple Animation classes to create staggered animations, which give a similar effect as the previous example.
